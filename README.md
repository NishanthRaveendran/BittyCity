# BittyCity

This is a city simulation game where the goal is to grow the city as large as possible. Created by Nishanth Raveendran, Rick Huang, Grace Liu, Wyatt Wismer, and Mustafa Choueib for *3A04 Final Project* in **Unity**.

The game begins with 2 citizens, a sidewalk, and a building. Citizens have the ability to build new sidewalks or buildings, or they can meet up to reproduce. As the game progresses, citizens will grow the city on their own.
